<h1>Guidelines</h1>

<h2>
Title
</h2>
<p>    
The title should not be too long. In the overview it gets truncated at about 70 characters.
</p>    




<h2>
Description
</h2>
<p>    
In general the description should be in good structured paragraphs, nicely formatted and of course make sense. Use the markdown synatx to format the text.
If you want to include any information about the methodology for some of the data files, you can add it to the description.
However if the description gets too large you can upload a readme pdf where you can go into details about any specifics about the data.
</p>    




<h2>
Tags / Keywords
</h2>
<p>    
Use tags which are connected to the topic in a sense of the meaning of the data instead of any technical requirements like "14 X 14 KM GRID".
Try to use existing tags the dropdown before creating new ones.
You can check common tags with your organisation (https://www.envidat.ch/dataset?organization=slf&_tags_limit=0)
</p>    

<p>    
Prefer the tags with 1 - 2 words, don't make or use tags like "ACCESSIBLE FOREST WITHOUT SHRUB FOREST" they will be truncated and are not fully readable.
If you feel like you would want to describe some a bit complex via keywords like "ACCESSIBLE FOREST WITHOUT SHRUB FOREST WITH YOUNG FOREST NFI3-NFI4"
break it up into multiple keywords which also alone would make sense like "FOREST" "NON-SHRUB" "YOUNG FOREST"
</p>    


<h2>
Data upload
</h2>
<p>    
You can upload files in the resources tab.
I think the maximum size of a file is 5GB, if you need to add a file larger than that you have to host it outside of envidat.ch and add it as a link.
As mentioned before you can add an additional file to describe any of the data if needed.
It is also possible to add a description to each datafile / resource, use markdown for formatting the description.
</p>    

<h2>
Some examples
</h2>
<p>    
Example of a good formatted Metadata:
<a href="https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/10-16904-envidat-27">https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/10-16904-envidat-27</a>
</p>    

<p>    
Example of a maybe a bit too long description:
<a href="https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/mountland-jura">https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/mountland-jura</a>
</p>    

<p>    
Bad Keywords example:
<a href="https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/salvage_logging_due_to_wind_star-250">https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/salvage_logging_due_to_wind_star-250</a>
</p>





<p>
You can add all these information step by step, just make sure you have the Visibility set to "unpublished"
